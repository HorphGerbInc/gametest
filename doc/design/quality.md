# Quality Control

## CI

We will utilize CI as one gateway into the repository.  The CI job will run pull requests against our tests and if they pass the pull request will be considered.  

## Unit Tests

Each module will have a set of unit tests.  The unit tests will cover at least 90% of the code.  All public functions should have a unit test.
